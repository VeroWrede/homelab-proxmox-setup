Project Overview  
Professional homelab setup implementing enterprise virtualization technologies using Proxmox VE on Dell OptiPlex hardware. Project structured in phases to handle real-world hardware constraints and demonstrate adaptive project management.

Current Status
Found pre-existing Proxmox VE installation on salvaged drive
Next: Network IP address reconfiguration for current subnet
Achievements so far: Successful restructuring of plan and hardware integration despite multiple missing or broken components

Technologies and Skills (demonstrated?) ⏳ 
- Virtualisation : Proxmox VE hypervisor deployment
- Linux Administration: custom installation, configuration and administration
- Network Troubleshooting: Hardware failure diagnosis and resolution
- Project Management: Adaptive planning and phased implementation
- Hardware Management: enterprise hardware repurposing and management
- Documentation: technical project documentation and architecture design
- Version Control: Git based project management
- Problem Solving: Real-world IT infrastructure challenges

Hardware Components
- Primary Host: Dell OptiPlex 
- Network: Direct connection to main router
- Future Enhancement: NETGEAR N600 Router (pending hardware repair/replacement)
